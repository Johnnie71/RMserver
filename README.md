# Chat App

![Demo Gif](gif/ChatApp.gif)

A responsive chat application that mimics chat services such as Slack or Microsoft Teams. Enabling users to create groups and have individual chats. With the help of [Streams API](https://getstream.io/) not only does it help scale the application, but users can reply to messages in a thread, react with emojis to messages, and send both gifs and pictures directly with ease. Also used [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) to be able to receive text message notifications if a user is not online!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

- To install dependencies

### `npm run dev`

- To run the application, which will use [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon)
